## contributing guidelines

thanks for your interest in helping with this codebase! i'm currently fairly shy
about other people poking around in this code, so please do not submit
unsolicited pull requests or begin work on any code you intend to PR without
contacting me first.

## contacting me

your best bet is to hail me on IRC for the specific game instance you're in; if
i'm not immediately present, please send me a PM so i don't lose your message in
the game chatter.

## bugs?

if something strange happens while you're playing, please contact me on IRC;
you're also welcome to open an issue in this repository so i can triage
appropriately. it's most helpful if you can provide a transcript of what
happened.

if there's a bug you think you can fix, please open an issue here first so it's
documented, and give me the opportunity to discuss a fix and greenlight your
plan before you start working on code.

## features?

i have a fairly strong sense of how i want game development to go, but i'm open
to your ideas about gameplay clarifications or interface/command improvements.
in general, plaintxtmines is intended to be a very minimal, somewhat
futile-feeling experience; i am always looking for ways to balance my sense of
gameplay with what's actually plausible.
