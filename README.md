# plaintxtmines
*begin with an enthusiastic !strike*

this is the engine for a text-based mining sim, with a front-end implemented for irc.

inspiration for this experience came from tilde.town, who, along with friends on
freenode, have provided excellent feedback and patience through rocky
livetesting.

*this repository contains spoilers!*

it goes without saying that all game secrets are visible in this codebase,
including flavortext, game formulas, progression, etc. if you are interested in
a clean game experience, please consider not looking at any of the code here!

*as of october 2017*

the current flagship instance is running in ##txtmines on irc.freenode.net; if
you have an account at tilde.town, you can also find it in #bots. it's more or
less stable, but since i'm vaguely working on this again, things may break
regularly.

*contributions*

if you find bugs/strange behavior, please feel free to open an issue or hit me
up in IRC. i'm currently not super keen on unsolicited PRs on this codebase, as
i'm in the middle of a fairly substantial overhaul and have a hard time staying
focused if i'm worrying about PRs.

i've written up guidelines for contributions to this project; please keep those
in mind if you don't already have an established feedback relationship with me!
