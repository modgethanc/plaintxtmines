# plaintxtmines
*begin with an enthusiastic !strike*

this is the engine for a text-based mining sim, with a front-end implemented for irc.

inspiration for this experience came from tilde.town, who, along with friends on
freenode, have provided excellent feedback and patience through rocky
livetesting.

*as of october 2017*

the current flagship instance is running in ##txtmines on irc.freenode.net; if
you have an account at tilde.town, you can also find it in #bots. it's more or
less stable, but since i'm vaguely working on this again, things may break
regularly.
