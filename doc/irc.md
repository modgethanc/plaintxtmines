IRC Usage
=========

IRC usage uses a config file (default irc.conf) with the following format:
    hostname.whatever
    #defaultchannel,#otherchannel,#whateveryouwant
    botnick
    adminnick

The bot will assume that adminnick is running the instance, and thus all admin
panel commands will be tied to anyone with that nick.
