This contains the class and functions for players.

On creation, a player is given a file with stats and a dossier. It's possible
for a player to exist without a dossier; players that burn their file can
restart the game with a clean state, but maintain all their physical stats.

Player attributes:
    (stats)
    name: name that the mining assistant addresses them
    aliases: list of strings for valid aliases
    lastStrike: int of timestamp of last strike
    strength: int of strength
    endurance: int of endurance
    lifetimeStrikes: int of total lifetime strikes
    lifetimeCompleted : int of total lifetime completed mines
    lifetimeGrovels: int of total lifetime grovels

    (dossier)
    minesOwned : list of strings of mine names the player owns
    minesAssigned: list of strings of mine names the player has additional
        permission to work on
    minesCompleted : list of strings of mine names the player has completed
    completionCount: int of number of mines cleared on this dossier
    minesAvailable: int of how many mines player can currently open
    resHeld: 8-item int array of currently held resources (*)
    grovelCount: int of current grovel count
    strikeCount: int of current strike count
    playing: boolean for if player has a dossier

(*): see documentation for mines for note about reslist

plaintxtmines is a text-based multiplayer mining simulator. For more
