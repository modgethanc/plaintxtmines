This is the core response generator for txtminebot.

All speaking modules should return a list of strings that correspond to an
appropriate response. Generating that response goes to helper modules. Control
game state from here.

Currently, these responses are designed for use with the IRC class in
controllers.py. This may be modified for support with other interfaces
eventually.

plaintxtmines is a text-based multiplayer mining simulator. For more
